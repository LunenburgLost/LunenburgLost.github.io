    <h2>The discovery</h2>
      <p>My name is Martha Willow and I am an author, professor and historian
      specialized in the history of Nova Scotia in the 18th century. </p>

      <p>A few weeks ago I found an old envelope tightly folded in the spine of
      an old Bible under the eaves of a barn that was being demolished near a
      village called Lunenburg, on the South Shore of Nova Scotia.</p>

      <p>The envelope contained a letter and two maps, hidden there by a local man
      called John Creighton in March 1782 and they describe what he calls a mysterious
      and powerful 'artefact' along with clues to its location.
      I will let you read his letter, it will give you all the information.</p>

      <i> You can read more about John Creighton in the notes I added below if you
      are interested. This is not needed to complete the quest.</i>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Looking for clues and finding danger</h2>
      <p>I can't resist an old map and the letter was so intriguing that I immediately
      started working on the clues. Soon it was taking all my time so I put my own
      research on hold and call this new project "Lunenburg Lost".</p>

      <p>It took me a couple of months and a lot of reading, but I managed to work
      out the location of the four points John Creighton mentions in his letter.
      That allowed me to find what he calls the "point of origin".
      Shortly after, I was able to find the "hidden instructions" he says he included ...
      and I also worked out the code he used to decrypt them.</p>

      <p> It's around that time that I received an offer from a very large multinational
      company to buy the letter and maps. I thought it was suspicious so I turned it down,
      at least until I found the artefact and understood what it was about.
      They increased their already considerable offer, and that made me downright
      worried and determined to keep everything to myself.
      Then a colleague whose research they were funding started threatening me
      and I thought I might be followed ... just shadows in the dark and footsteps
      behind me, so I can't be sure but when my office was broken into and most of
      my work was stolen I had to do something before the letter, the maps and the artefact fell into
      the hands of ... who knows.</p>

      <p> Luckily, I had taken the "Lunenburg Lost" files home with me on the day of the
      break in, so they are still in my possession, but it won't be long before they try again.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Over to you ...</h2>
      <p>This is where you come in. I decided to leave town for a long overdue field trip
      for my actual work, hoping that they will follow me. This should buy you enough
      time to find the artefact in peace. To save you time, I have sent you the
      contents of my desk drawer, mess and all, so that you can pick up where I left off.</p>

      <p>In addition, so that you don't have to do the research again, I am giving you
      the location of the four points so you can find what John Creighton calls
      the "point of origin". But for added safety, I have hidden that information in various
      documents in the package you received.</p>

      <p>I have also left you a clue to find the location of the "hidden instructions"
      and another clue to help you decrypt it.
      That should be enough to get you to work out the location of the artefact.

      Finally, I also setup this website to communicate with you (you can use
      my email address safely, they are not aware of its existence).</p>

      <p>When you have found the location of the artefact, you'll need to
      email me the following information:</p>

      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:500px">
        <li>A distance, with units</li>
        <li>A cardinal direction</li>
        <li>A point of origin</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>For example: 67 rods, North West from the Gravel Wharf</i></p>

      <p>I will then go and retrieve it and send it to you for safekeeping.
      If you need to contact me, you can email me ... this website </p>

      <p>Your help is invaluable to me and I am very grateful we can collaborate
      on this quest. Whatever the artefact is, it must not fall into the hands of
      those who want to misuse it! </p>
