    <h2>Avoiding danger</h2>
      <p>I asked a friend to recommend someone clever, based in Lunenburg and who could
      keep a secret and he recommended you. I am taking a risk sharing all this with you
      without even having met you, but I am running out of time. I hope I am not
      making a mistake in entrusting you with this quest.</p>

      <p>I am leaving town for a long overdue field trip for a few week for my actual work:
      they will follow me thinking I will take them to the location of the artefact,
      and this should buy you enough time to find the artefact.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Over to you ...</h2>
      <p>I have sent you a package with the contents of my desk so that you can pick up where I left off.
        In addition to the usual desk mess, you will get the envelope from William Loffer with his letter and his maps,
        and so that you don't have to do the research again, I have also included the work that I did so far to
        identify the elements mentionned by William Loffer in his letter:</p>
      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:500px">
        <li>clues to the location of the four points </li>
        <li>a clue to the location of the 'hidden instructions'</li>
        <li>a clue to the key to decrypt those instructions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I am only sending you clues (rather than the actual information) for added safety.
      You will have to figure out what the actual elements are, based on the clues and your knowledge of Lunenburg.</p>

      <p>If you need help working out the clues, you can get tips and check your answers here:</p>

      <br>
      <h2>How it ends</h2>
      <p>When you have found the location of the artefact, you'll need to
      email me the following information:</p>

      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:500px">
        <li>A distance, with units</li>
        <li>A cardinal direction</li>
        <li>A point of origin</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>For example: 67 rods, North West from the Gravel Wharf</i> <br>
      <i>Or: 18 rods, South of Tar Beach</i></p>

      <p>I will then go and retrieve it and send it to you for safekeeping.</p>

      <br>
      <p>If you need to contact me, you can email me at the address I give you on this website
      (you can use it safely, they are not aware of the existence of this website).

      <p>Your help is invaluable and I am very grateful we can collaborate
      on this quest. Whatever the artefact is, it must not fall into the hands of
      those who want to misuse it and I look forward to sending it to you for safekeeping. </p>

      <p>
