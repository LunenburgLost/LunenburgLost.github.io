    <h2>Over to you ...</h2>
      <p>Following the discovery of the envelope, the decryption of its contents, the
      unwanted attention it was attracting and the fire that destroyed my office,


      I decided to leave town for a long overdue field trip for my actual work,
      hoping that they will follow me.

      This should buy you enough time to find the artefact in peace. To save you time,
      I have sent you the contents of my desk drawer, mess and all, so that you can pick up where I left off.</p>

      <p>In addition, so that you don't have to do the research again, I am giving you
      the location of the four points so you can find what John Creighton calls
      the "point of origin". But for added safety, I have hidden that information in various
      documents in the package you received.</p>

      <p>I have also left you a clue to find the location of the "hidden instructions"
      and another clue to help you decrypt it.
      That should be enough to get you to work out the location of the artefact.

      Finally, I also setup this website to communicate with you (you can use
      my email address safely, they are not aware of its existence).</p>

      <p>When you have found the location of the artefact, you'll need to
      email me the following information:</p>

      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:500px">
        <li>A distance, with units</li>
        <li>A cardinal direction</li>
        <li>A point of origin</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>For example: 67 rods, North West from the Gravel Wharf</i></p>

      <p>I will then go and retrieve it and send it to you for safekeeping.
      If you need to contact me, you can email me ... this website </p>

      <p>Your help is invaluable and I am very grateful we can collaborate
      on this quest. Whatever the artefact is, it must not fall into the hands of
      those who want to misuse it and I look forward to sending it to you for safekeeping. </p>

      <p>
