    <h2>Avoiding danger</h2>
      <p>I need someone to finish what I started and complete the last step:
        use both maps to find the location of the sacratium.</p>

      <p>I asked a friend to recommend someone clever, based in Lunenburg and who could
      keep a secret and he recommended you. I am taking a risk sharing all this with you
      without even having met you, but I am running out of time. I hope I am not
      making a mistake in entrusting you with this quest.</p>

      <p>While I am out of town, taking 'them' on a wild goose chase, I hope you will agree to pick up
        where I left off and complete the search for William Loffer's sacrarium.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Over to you ...</h2>
      <p>I have sent you a package with the contents of my desk that I saved on the day of the fire.
        In addition to the usual desk mess, you will find the envelope from William Loffer with his letter and his maps,
        along with the work I completed so far to locate the burial site of the sacrarium. </p>

      <p> However, as an additional precaution, I have encrypted my work so you will need to
        figure out the clues I left for you:</p>
      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:500px">
        <li>four clues to the location of the houses of John Creighton's four children's godfathers </li>
        <li>one clue to find the hidden instructions on the map</li>
        <li>one clue to work out the keyword to decrypt the hidden instructions on the map</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: Some clues are obvious while others are hidden, sometimes in plain sight  ... </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>How it ends</h2>
      <p>When you have found the location of the sacrarium, you'll need to
      email me the following information:</p>

      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:500px">
        <li>A distance, with units</li>
        <li>A cardinal direction</li>
        <li>A point of origin</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>For example: 67 rods, North North West from the Gravel Wharf</i> <br>
      <i>Or: 180 feet, South East of Tar Beach</i></p>

      <p>I will then go and retrieve it and send it to you for safekeeping.</p>

      <br>
      <p>If you need to contact me for any reason, you can email me at the address I give you on this website
      (you can use it safely, 'they' are not aware of the existence of this website).

      <p>Your help is invaluable and I am very grateful we can collaborate
      on this quest. Whatever the sacrarium is, it must not fall into the hands of
      those who want to misuse it and I look forward to sending it to you for safekeeping. </p>

      <p> Good luck! </p>
