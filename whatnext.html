    <h2>What next ...?</h2>
      <p>My name is Martha Willow and I am an author, professor and historian
      studying the history of Nova Scotia in the 18th century. In particular, I
      study the interactions between the First Nation tribes and the settlers
      that led to a fusion of their knowledge, language and customs.</p>

      <p>Over the course of my work I came upon a letter from a man called John
      Creighton who, along with four other men, founded a village called Lunenburg
      in 1753.</p>

      <p>In 1782, Lunenburg was subjected to an attack from an American privateer,
      an event called the Sack of Lunenburg. <i>You can read more about this
      historical event on another section of this website, but this isn't
      required for you to suceed in your mission.</i></p>

      <p>During this attack, John Creighton was made prisoner and taken to Boston
      (USA) while his captors waited for a ransom to be paid. It is not clear what
      happened, but no ransom was ever paid and shortly after his arrival, John
      Creighton was sent back home to Lunenburg.</p>

      <p>Not a very mysterious story ... until a few weeks ago when I found a letter
      from John Creighton along with two maps, folded in the spine of an old Bible
      abandoned in a barn that was being demolished. The letter was written immediately upon
      his return to Lunenburg in March 1782 and describes a mysterious and powerful 'artefact'
      that he acquired after being captured and hid upon his return to Lunenburg.</p>

      <p>The letter gives clues to the location of the artefact and I immediately
      stopped all my regular work to look for this location, following the directions
      he left in his letter:</p>

      <ul class="listsquare" style="max-width:100px">
        <li>Find what he calls the 'primary location'</li>
        <li>Find and decrypt hidden instructions to go from the 'primary location' to the final location</li>
        <li>Locate and retrieve the artefact</li>
      </ul>
