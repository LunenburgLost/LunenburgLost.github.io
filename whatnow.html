    <h2>The discovery</h2>
      <p>A few weeks ago I found an old envelope tightly folded in the spine of
      an old Bible under the eaves of a barn that was being demolished near a
      village called Lunenburg, on the South Shore of Nova Scotia.</p>

      <p>The envelope contained a letter and two maps, hidden there by a local man
      called William Loffer who was taken captive alongside John Creighton during the
      Sack of Lunenburg in July 1782. They were taken to Boston where
      they were held hostage for ransom. There is no record of a ransom being paid
      but a few weeks after their arrival they were sent back to Lunenburg. </p>

      <p> It appears that at some point, either during their
      imprisonment in Boston or on the ship on their way back, they met a man
      who was likely some kind of trader/adventurer/mercenary. There is no record of the man's
      name or where he was from, but there is evidence that he gave William Loffer a pouch
      containing three sacred and powerful objects which the man called 'sacrarium' and
      claimed would grant magical powers to those who knew how to work the ritual.</p>

      <p>William Loffer appears to have been convinced of the sacrarium's powers and
      upon arrival in Lunenburg, afraid of its potency, prompty buried it to keep it
      out of the hands of those who might misuse it.</p>

      <p>I will let you read his letter, it will give you more information.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>The search begins</h2>
      <p>I can't resist an old map and the letter was so intriguing that I immediately
      started working on the clues to locate the sacrarium. Soon it was taking all my time so I put my own
      research on hold and called this new project: Lunenburg Lost.</p>

      <p>It took me a couple of months and a lot of reading and researching and rubbing
      shoulders with more crusty, dusty archive keepers that I care to say, but I managed to work
      out the first clue in William Loffer's letter: <b>the location of the four houses of John Creighton's children's godfather</b>
      and from then it was easy to find the <b>center</b> that he refers to.
      Shortly after, I was able to find the <b>hidden instructions</b> William Loffer says he hid on the map of Lunenburg...</p>

      <p>It was so exciting, I was getting so close!</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Danger looms</h2>
      <p> Just as I was on the verge of figuring out the location of the sacrarium and
      organising a trip to retrieve it, I received a very generous offer from a large multinational bank
      to buy William Loffer's letter and maps and desist from any further searching.
      I was so careful not to mention my research to anyone,
      I couldn't figure out how they would have even heard of me. Being naturally cautious I turned down their offer,
      at least until I found the sacrarium and understood what it was I had in my possession. </p>

      <p> They increased their already considerable offer, and that made me downright
      suspicious. And then a few days later, a colleague whose research I knew they were funding
      was seen trying to break into my office after I had left for the day. That same night, I had the impression
      I might be followed ... just shadows in the dark and footsteps behind me, so I can't be sure but I was getting
      increasingly concerned for my safety. </p>

      <p>Then one morning last week, while most of the staff was out for lunch,
      a fire broke out in my office building and the alarm didn't go off.
      I just had time to run back to my office and empty the contents of my desk in a bag before running outside to safety.
      I don't think the fire was an accident. I knew I wasn't safe anymore
      and that it wouldn't be long before they tried again. </p>

      <p>In order to keep myself and William Loffer's documents safe, I devised a plan. I would leave Lunenburg for a while,
      hoping 'they' would follow me thinking I would take them to the location of the buried sacrarium. That would leave
      the coast clear for someone else to continue the quest, someone who they would not be aware of. </p>

      <p>And this is where you come in ... </p>
