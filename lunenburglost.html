    <h1>WELL DONE!</h1>
    <hr>
    I am so glad you managed to get this far, it means I made the right choice
    in entrusting you with my research.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am a historian studying the history of Nova Scotia in the 18th century and
    in particular the events of the Sack of Lunenburg in 1782 where John Creighton,
    one of the founders of Lunenburg, was taken hostage and brought to Boston.
    Although no ransom was paid, he was quickly released and returned to Lunenburg
    in March 1782.
    <br>
    You can read more about this event and about John Creighton on my website.
    <br>
    <br>
    I found a letter from John Creighton and two maps hidden in the binding of
    a Bible found under the eaves of a barn that was been torn down. 
    to the location of an ‘artefact’ he buried when he came back from Boston.
    [short recap of the contents of his letter]
    <br>
    <br>
    It is not clear what that artefact is, but it looked intriguing enough that I
    wanted to find out more, so I set my original research aside to follow the steps
    he gives to find it:
    1-	Find the primary location on the map of Lunenburg
    2-	Follow hidden instructions to use this primary location to find the actual
    location of the artefact
    <br>
    <br>
    It took me several months but I finally found the primary location on the map.
    However, before I could figure out the hidden instructions to locate the artefact,
    I started to see [describe scary things happening]. Clearly, I wasn’t working so secretly.
    I don’t know who they are but they seem very powerful because [reasons].
    <br>
    <br>
    I have to disappear for a while because I don’t want to continue my research
    and lead them to the artefact. But they don’t know about you so I am counting
    on you to complete my work.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before I left, I just had time to write down clues to the primary location for
    you and then quickly grabbed and packed the contents of my desk. I am sending
    everything to you so that you can pick up where I left off: after you work out
    the primary location, you’ll have to find and decrypt the hidden instructions
    to locate the artefact.
    <br>
    <br>
    When you have found the location of the artefact, let me know where it is by
    emailing me at this address so that I can retrieve it. I will need to know
    the following:
      Distance
      Units
      Cardinal direction
      Point of origin
	    (for example: 67 rods, NW from the Gravel Wharf)
      <br>
      <br>
      I will then retrieve the artefact and send it to you for safekeeping … you
      deserve to be the keeper of this item and it will be much safer with you.
      <br>
      <br>
      With many thanks for your collaboration,
      <br>
      <br>
      Martha Willow

      PS - I have scanned all my research and you can download (and print) all
      the documents from here if you need to.
