    <h5>The Sack of Lunenburg (Nova Scotia), 1782</h5>
    <p>Congratulations on finding the secret website I set up to share more information
      with you. </p>

      <p>In a few days you'll receive a package with all my research and along with
      the contents of this website you'll have everything you need to complete my
      work and find the secret object I was looking for.</p>

      <p>For added security, the information in this website is protected by a password,
      which is hidden in the package you will receive. </p>

      <p>Here is a clue: look for something that will
      never be number one.</p>
