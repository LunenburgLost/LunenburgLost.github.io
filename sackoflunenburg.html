    <h2>The discovery</h2>
      <p>My name is Martha Willow and I am an author, professor and historian
      specialized in the history of Nova Scotia in the 18th century. In particular, I
      study the blended knowledge, vocabulary and customs that came out of the
      interactions between the First Nation tribes and the original settlers.</p>

      <p>A few weeks ago I found an old envelope tightly folded in the spine of
      an old Bible under the eaves in a barn that was being demolished near a
      village called Lunenburg, on the South Shore of Nova Scotia.</p>

      <p>The envelope contained a letter and two maps, hidden there by a local man
      called John Creighton in March 1782 and they describe a mysterious and powerful 'artefact'
      along with clues to its location.
      I will let you read his letter, it will give you all the information you need.</p>

      <i> You can read more about John Creighton and his capture and release in
        the notes I added below. Knowledge of either is not required to complete
        the quest.</i>
